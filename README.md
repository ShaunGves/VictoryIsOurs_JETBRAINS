JetBrains-based developer productivity tool that combines a Code Stopper mechanism with Speech-to-Text programming support to help developers code faster, smarter, and with fewer interruptions.

Built on the JetBrains IntelliJ Platform, the tool actively monitors coding behavior and temporarily halts execution or editing when it detects risky actions such as infinite loops, runaway processes, or unintentional resource-heavy operations. This “Code Stopper” acts as a real-time safety layer, preventing crashes, wasted compute time, and debugging overhead before issues escalate.

In parallel, the prototype integrates Speech-to-Text functionality, allowing developers to write code, add comments, navigate files, and trigger IDE actions using voice commands. This reduces context switching, supports hands-free coding, and improves accessibility—especially during rapid prototyping, brainstorming, or debugging sessions.

By combining proactive code interruption with voice-driven development, the prototype introduces a new interaction model for IDEs—one that prioritizes developer flow, safety, and accessibility. The concept is designed to scale across languages and frameworks supported by JetBrains, making it a powerful foundation for next-generation developer tools.
